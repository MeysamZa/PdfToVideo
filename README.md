# PdfToVideo
This repo uses free tools to convert pdf pages to video file (out.mp4)

Before running Make_Video.bat :
1-Download and Install ImageMagick
2-download and Install GhostScript
3-Download and Copy ffmpeg.exe to Prerequisite folder

By default there is 5 second delay for each pdf page in created video (you can change it in m.ps1)
